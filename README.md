# My Portfolio

A minimalist black and white portfolio website built with modern web technologies. Clean, simple, and focused on showcasing work without distractions.

## What's Inside

This portfolio is built with some of my favorite tools:

- **React** - The heart of the application, handling all the interactive components
- **Tailwind CSS** - For that clean, utility-first styling approach
- **React Router** - Smooth navigation between different sections
- **Framer Motion** - Subtle animations that bring the site to life

## The Design Philosophy

I wanted to create something that feels timeless and professional. The black and white color scheme keeps things focused on the content rather than flashy colors. Every animation and transition has a purpose - to guide the user's attention and create a smooth browsing experience.

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The site will open at `http://localhost:3000` and you're good to go!

## Project Structure

The portfolio is organized into clean, logical sections:

- **Home** - A welcoming introduction
- **About** - Who I am and what I do
- **Projects** - Showcasing my work
- **Contact** - Ways to get in touch

Each section has its own component with carefully crafted animations that feel natural and not overwhelming.

## Why These Technologies?

- **React** gives me the component-based structure I love
- **Tailwind** makes styling fast and consistent
- **React Router** keeps navigation smooth and modern
- **Framer Motion** adds just the right amount of polish

## Building for Production

Ready to deploy? Just run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build ready for deployment.

## Future Improvements

I'm always looking to make this better:
- Adding more interactive elements
- Optimizing performance further
- Maybe adding a blog section
- Improving accessibility features
